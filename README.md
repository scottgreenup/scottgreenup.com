# Abstract

## Warning
This is the code for my personal site. I am still developing it at the moment, so please consider it a work in progress.

## Technologies
This code uses no third-party libraries like Bootstrap or jQuery; the only third-party involved in the website is [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts). I am running the server code with Go and all front-end code is developed by me. The reason I am doing this is to learn raw web-development and also show my understanding of Go, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## Features
### Blog Engine
Under `blog/` is a markdown to HTML blog engine. It's still under-development and will be recieving a refactor soon.
