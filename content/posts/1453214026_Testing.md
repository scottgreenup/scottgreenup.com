# Quantum Physics

I was driving a friend back to his hotel in Mountain View, along the way we began to talk about his course in Quantum Computing. I asked him to explain to me some basic Quantum Physics for the layman. He did. He left me asking "What the hell?", something I should've expected when talking about Quantum Physics. This confusion irked me. I decided to go online and find a video on YouTube that might give some answers and subsequently found [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZ3bPUKo5zc](this video). This video is part of a series on [ocw.mit.edu](MIT's OpenCourseWare) that I've started to do. I highly recommend watching the lectures in this course for 3 reasons:

 1. You'll have your mind blown.
 2. You'll understand why physicists are having their mind blown.
 3. You'll appreciate the world more.
