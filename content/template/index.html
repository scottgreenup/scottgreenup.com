          <h1>Software engineer.</h1>
          <p>I've taken up engineering as my career and passion. I am still at student at the <a href="http://sydney.edu.au/">University of Sydney</a>, completing a <a href="http://sydney.edu.au/courses/bachelor-of-information-technology">Bachelor of Information Technology (Computer Science)</a>. I have a keen interest in networking applications; including website backends and multiplayer games. I've done work and </p>

          <h1>Travel junkie.</h1>
          <p>I unequivocally love to travel. I am hooked. I've been to New Zealand, Japan, and I am currently in the United States. New Zealand was absolutely stunning and I would highly recommend visiting the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Kh4LVRZ5FJU2">South Island</a>; I distinctly remember a moment where we were driving along and forgot to take photos because of the breathaking mountain ranges.</p>
          <p>Japan is a country with deep and fascinating culture and has delicious food. I can not wait for a second-trip to Japan; I could go back to Tokyo again and again. I am currently in the United States and enjoying life in Mountain View while visiting the gorgeous national parks in the area.</p>

          <h1>Games developer.</h1>
          <p>I relish in the creation of 3D games. A game can cover every discipline of software engineering; including AI, networking, graphics, audio, data structures, design patterns, complex algorithms, optimisation techniques, data storage, security, and more. I am currently building a <a href="https://github.com/scottgreenup/ProjectImperial">3D game engine</a> as a side-project.</p>

          <h1>Security enthusiast.</h1>
          <p>The internet is colossal and it is growing at stupendous rate. Security is becoming a more prevalent and dire requirement due to the growing amount of data being stored online. It has become an interesting area and concerns almost every website. It's amazing what comes out of the wood-work. I personally have taking an interest in security and I believe that all engineers should, as it can concern various levels of a project in different ways.</p>
